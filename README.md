# ShakespeareLSTM

The text data used for this project was retrived from [textfiles.com](http://www.textfiles.com/etext/AUTHORS/SHAKESPEARE/).

[This tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/generating-text-with-tensorflow-2-0-6a65c7bdc568) was very helpful.

The directory structure needed for saving files is as so:

```
ShakespeareLSTM
--> checkpoints
    --> v1_checkpoints
    --> v2_checkpoints
    --> v3_checkpoints
    --> v4_checkpoints
--> data_analysis
--> output
    --> pdf_output
    --> v1_output
    --> v2_output
    --> v3_output
    --> v4_output
```
